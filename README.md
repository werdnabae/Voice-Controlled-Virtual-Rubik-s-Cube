# Voice-Controlled Virtual Rubik's Cube

This repo contains the code for a virtual Rubik's cube that is controlled by voice. Report for this project can be found [here](https://andrewbae.me/files/virtual_cube_report.pdf).



## How to use

1. Run VCVRC.py
2. Say "begin" to start inspection
3. Start solving!

## Voice Command List
Voice commands are based off standard Rubik's cube notation. Additionally, several algorithms for the CFOP solving method have been added. The full voice commands can be found in the voice_commands.pdf file.
